# Salon_Appointment_Scheduler
Salon Appointment Scheduler
This is one of the required projects to earn my freeCodeCamp 'Relational Database Certification'.
For this project, I had to create an interactive Bash program that uses PostgreSQL to track the customers and appointments of a salon.
An salon.sh is an file for the bash script and Database dump (after inserting data): salon.sql
